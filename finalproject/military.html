        <p> Military aviation in Mozambique is closely tied to the country’s struggle for independence, the long civil
            war, and later efforts at national reconstruction.
            It evolved from a guerrilla-style air capability in the 1960s–70s to a small conventional air force in the
            1980s–90s, and today remains a limited but still active force focused on sovereignty and internal security.

                <h2>Before Independence (1960s–1974)</h2>
                <p>Mozambique was under Portuguese rule, and FRELIMO, the independence movement, had no air power of its
                    own
                    in the early years. All aviation was controlled by Portugal, and guerrilla forces operated entirely
                    on
                    the ground.

                    Late in the independence struggle (early 1970s), friendly countries — especially the Soviet Union
                    and
                    some African allies — began training FRELIMO personnel in aviation support roles. This laid the
                    groundwork for what would become the Mozambican Air Force.</p>

                <h2> Birth of the Mozambican People’s Air Force: FAPM (1975)</h2>


                <p>When Mozambique became independent on 25 June 1975, the new state created its air arm:

                    FAPM – Força Aérea Popular de Moçambique

                    Its first aircraft were Soviet-made, reflecting Cold War alignments.

                </p>
                <h4>Early inventory included:</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>An-2 transport biplanes</li>
                    <li>Mi-8 helicopters</li>
                    <li>MiG-17 fighters (retired early)</li>
                    <li>An-26 and An-24 transports</li>
                    <li>Let-410 light transports</li>
                    <li>MiG-21 fighters (arrived late 1970s/early 1980s)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The force benefited heavily from:

                    Soviet training

                    Military aid from East Germany and Cuba

                    Dozens of Mozambican pilots trained abroad (USSR, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria)</p>

                <p>The civil war between the government and RENAMO greatly shaped military aviation. Primary roles of
                    the
                    Air Force during the war:

                    Troop transport,
                    Supply flights to remote garrisons,

                    Helicopter support and medevac,

                    Reconnaissance,

                    Occasional light strike missions,

                    Key aircraft at the time,

                    An-26 and An-24 for logistics,

                    Mi-8 and Mi-17 helicopters (workhorses of the war),

                    MiG-21 fighters (limited use due to cost, maintenance, and training complexity),

                    Ilyushin Il-14 and Il-18 (rare, used mainly for VIP and cargo),

                <h4>Many aircraft operated from:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Maputo</li>
                    <li>Beira</li>

            <p>After the 1992 Rome Peace Agreement, Mozambique sharply reduced defense spending.

                Consequences for the Air Force:

            <h4> Many aircraft grounded</h4>

            MiG-21 fighter fleet fell out of service by the late 1990s.
            Transport aircraft were stored or cannibalized for parts.

            <p>From the early 2010s, Mozambique attempted to rebuild its air capability, though on a small scale.

            <h4>New acquisitions and upgrades </h4>

            Mi-17 helicopter overhaul programs

            Acquisition of Y12 (Harbin) light transports from China

            Cessna and small aircraft for training

            <h4> Major role in counter-insurgency </h4>

            Since 2017, Mozambique has faced insurgency in Cabo Delgado.
            The air force’s role includes:

            Surveillance

            Troop transport

            Medevac

            Aerial supply missions

            Some partners (Rwanda, South Africa, EU forces) provide training and support.

            <h4>Current challenges </h4>

            Limited funding

            Aging Soviet inventory

            Small number of trained pilots

            Dependence on foreign technicians</p>
